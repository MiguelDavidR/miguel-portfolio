    <h1>Inclusive Programming Strategy</h1>
    <p>Championing representation, equity, and belonging across film, tech, and storytelling events</p>

    <p>
      Across every project I've led ‚Äî from genre film festivals to university innovation conferences ‚Äî inclusive programming has been a guiding principle. Not just a checkbox, but a curatorial mindset: Who gets to speak? Who gets to be seen? Whose stories are we platforming? This page outlines some of the intentional strategies and efforts that helped shape that vision.
    </p>

    <h2>üé¨ Horrible Imaginings Film Festival</h2>
    <p>
      From its founding, Horrible Imaginings built a reputation for elevating underrepresented voices in genre storytelling ‚Äî embracing horror, sci-fi, and dark art as powerful tools for exploring identity, trauma, and justice. Our programming platformed creators from historically marginalized backgrounds and fostered dialogue around difficult themes.
    </p>

    <h3>üîä Interviews and Articles</h3>
    <p>The following interviews, articles, and recordings include significant moments where the strength of the inclusive approach was both notices and appreciated by audience, artists, and members of the press.

    <h3>üé≠ Genre as Social Mirror</h3>
    <p>
      Many of our most acclaimed screenings used speculative genre to unpack real-world concerns ‚Äî including colonization, reproductive autonomy, cultural grief, and disability. We approached horror not as escapism, but as a lens for empathy and meaning-making.
    </p>

    <h3>üß© Access & Community</h3>
    <p>
      We implemented accessible ticketing tiers, hybrid screening options, captioned videos, and intentional outreach to build a festival environment where more people felt like they belonged ‚Äî both on stage and in the audience.
    </p>

    <h2>üí° UC Tech & Process Palooza (In Progress)</h2>
    <p>
      Inclusive programming has extended into my work in higher education and tech leadership ‚Äî including diverse speaker selection, multilingual and accessible content strategies, and DEI-centered panel planning. This section will be updated to showcase specific examples from UC Tech and Process Palooza events.
